# Credible CLI

The Credible CLI is a command-line interface for the Credible Layer.

## Installation

## Build from Source

It requires the following:

  - `just`
  - `Rust 1.80`
  - `git`

After you have installed the above, you can build the CLI by running the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/credible-layer/credible-cli.git
cd credible-cli
just build-all
```

This will build the CLI and install it in the `target/release` directory.
